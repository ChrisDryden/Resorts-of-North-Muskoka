	Couples Packages	If you want a quiet retreat from the city, we offer a "couples" rate of $125.00 per cottage per night in our off season. This is available during most midweeks for the rest of the fall/winter except March Break. You must stay at least two nights, and use only one bedroom of the cottage.  We close for April, but the same offer is available for May and most of June so call us for details and dates. We usually have good snow conditions for skiing from Dec 20 to about Mar. 20 	Bondi Village Resort	02	11	2006		http://www.bondi-cottage-resort.com	btapley@vianet.on.ca
