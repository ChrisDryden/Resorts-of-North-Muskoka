The Pines Cottage Resort has a long standing reputation for its friendly atmosphere. Over the years guests have made friendships with other guests which extend to socializing with each other throughout the entire year. The Pines Cottage Resort is associated with Camp Tanamakoon for girls and Bartlett Lodge, a Modified American Plan Resort.  Spend an evening of fine dining at the Pines sister resort Bartlett Lodge.  Both of these businesses are located in the heart of Algonquin Park and have been operated by the Kim and Marilyn Smith for over 12 years. The Smiths' experience in the resort industry and their knowledge of the local area means The Pines Cottage Resort was build on its already strong reputation as a quiet friendly retreat on the doorstep of Algonquin Park.</p>
