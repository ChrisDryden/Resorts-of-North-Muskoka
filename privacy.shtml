			<p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p>

			<p>THE PRIVACY POLICY NorthMuskoka Tourism Promotion Corporation operating as Resorts of North Muskoka (RoNM)
			Protecting your privacy and the confidentiality of your information – over the internet, on the telephone, or through our office, has always been fundamental to the way we do business at the Resorts of North Muskoka (herein called the ‘RoNM’).
			The RoNM operates on the basis of a Privacy Policy and related procedures that guide the handling of the personal information we collect. The RoNM has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to protecting the privacy of our members, partners and potential website visitors. This policy and related procedures are consistent with the Canadian Standards Association Model Code for the Protection of Personal Information (herein ‘CSA Model Code’) and applicable privacy legislation.</p>

			<p><strong>PRIVACY STATEMENT</strong></p>

			<p>This policy deals only with personal information handled by the RoNM. Personal information is information about an identifiable individual, excluding business contact information. The following explains how the RoNM handles personal information. The RoNM reserved the right to change this policy and it may be updated periodically. These changes may affect our use of your personal information. Accordingly, please check for changes regularly.</p>

			<p><strong>ACCOUNTABILITY</strong></p>

			<p>The RoNM is accountable for all personal information under its control. The RoNM’s privacy officer is Mr. Kim Smith who is designated as responsible for the RoNM’s privacy policy. The Privacy Officer can be reached by:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Email at – northmuskoka@gmail.com</li>
				<li>Telephone at – 905.338.8908</li>
				<li>Mail at – 132 Reynolds Street, Oakville, Ontario   L6J 3K5</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>The RoNM will not use personal information for any other purpose than identified at or before the time of collection.</p>

			<p><strong>CONSENT</strong></p>

			<p>The RoNM seeks consent for all personal information collected, used and disclosed through information provided to individuals prior to collection, or at the time of collection.</p>

			<p>If you have voluntarily provided information, you have consented to the collection, use and disclosure of your personally identifiable information as described in this privacy policy. As required by the CSA Model Code, the RoNM will not use personal information for any purpose other than that for which you consented.</p>

			<p>Should the RoNM require personal information for a new purpose, we will contact you to seek consent for that new use.</p>

			<p><strong>LIMITS FOR COLLECTING, USING, DISCLOSING AND KEEPING PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong></p>
			
			<p>The RoNM does not collect, use or disclose personal information of individuals except when individuals give consent and provide the information on a voluntary basis. There may be occasions where more specific personal information is necessary for us to proceed with a request for information, or provide you with a product or service. In such cases, we will provide you with a description on the information we need. In all cases, the RoNM will limit the amount and type of information collected to only the personal information that is required to provide the individual with the requested information, product, or service. We collect only information that is voluntarily provided by you and undertake that such information will be kept strictly confidential.</p>

			<p>The RoNM retains information only as long as is necessary to provide the individual with the requested product, service or information and delete or destroy this information after that time, i.e. if personal information is given to enable you to register for an event, the personal information will only be used for this event and will then be deleted or destroyed. In some cases, however, legal reporting and retention requirements necessitate that the RoNM retain information for a specific amount of time. In general, the RoNM retains information for a period not longer than two (2) years.</p>

			<p>The RoNM does not sell or trade any personal information with third parties. The RoNM may transfer information to service providers where information processing is outsourced by the RoNM in the course of its administrative procedures or members services in specific cases. Where personal information is transferred to a service provider for processing, we require the service provider to respect this Privacy Policy and we restrict them from using or disclosing personal information transferred to them for any purpose other than the provision of services to us. Any personal information that the RoNM retains is kept in such a manner as to ensure its security and confidentiality at all times.</p>

			<p><strong>SAFEGUARDING PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong></p>

			<p>The RoNM respects the privacy of our members, partners, potential website visitors and Internet users and will protect that privacy as vigorously as possible. The RoNM stores personal information in electronic and physical files that to the best of their ability, are secure. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while the RoNM strives to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or receive from us electronically. This is especially true for information you transmit to us via e-mail. We have no way of protecting that information until it reaches us. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best efforts to ensure its security on our servers.</p>

			<p><strong>ACCURACY OF AND ACCESS TO PERSONAL INFORMATION COLLECTED</strong></p>

			<p>The RoNM makes every effort to keep personal information as accurate, complete, current and relevant as necessary for the identified purposes. The RoNM does not routinely update personal information.</p>

			<p>The RoNM makes readily available to individuals our Privacy Policy and related procedures for managing personal information. The RoNM provides access to the Privacy Policy and related procedures to individuals on the RoNM’s website and/or in written form. Any questions about the handling of personal information by the RoNM can be raised with the RoNM Privacy Officer.
			At the written request of an individual, he or she may view or edit their personal information as collected by the RoNM. The RoNM will inform them of what personal information we have about the individual, what it is being used for and, in cases where it has been disclosed, to whom it has been disclosed. There may be exceptional circumstances as provided by the CSA Model Code under which the RoNM may not be able to give an individual access to the personal information about her or him held by the RoNM.</p>

			<p>In this case the RoNM will explain the reason for this lack of access, as provided by the CSA Model Code.
			To make a request, please: send a letter, email or fax, addressed to the RoNM Privacy Officer at the address indicated above. In your request, please include the following information:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Name</li>
				<li>Contact details</li>
				<li>Membership Number (if applicable)</li>
			</ul>

			<p>The nature of your request, including whether you wish to view and/or edit information or inquire regarding use and/or disclosure.</p>

			<p>The RoNM will reply to your request in no later than thirty (30) days after receipt of the request, or if we are not able to respond within this time period, we will send you a notice of extension. If we are not able to disclose all personal information we hold on you, we will give you a reason for our inability to do so, unless prohibited by law.</p>
