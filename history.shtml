			<img src="images/history1.jpg" alt="resort history" align="right" hspace="10" />
			Muskoka is the most well known cottage country and resort area in Ontario and it's only 90 minutes by car from Toronto. Thirty minutes farther down the road you enter North Muskoka also known as the the gateway to Algonquin Park. Covering 2,500 square miles, Muskoka is filled with rugged natural beauty. You'll find towering pines, picturesque waterfalls and sparkling lakes and rivers. There is an almost endless choice of recreational activities, diverse culture and all presented to you with a style of service that is both genuine and friendly. </p>

			<p>Almost all of the resorts have long histories, in some cases ones that span more than a century. But whether a resort has been in the same family for three or four generations or has newer owners who honour its storied past, one thing is certain: you'll find a warm, family-friendly atmosphere at an affordable price. <a href="summer_traditions.shtml">Read more about how to create your own family traditions in North Muskoka.</a></p>

			In 2004 a small group of resort operators form the North Muskoka lake area joined forces to market the north eastern region as a more rugged and less developed resort destination distinct from the busier central and western more commonly known Muskoka region. North Muskoka resorts were located east of Huntsville and stretching over towards Algonquin Park in the Lake of Bays area. Lakes represented by resorts from the original group did include Mary Lake, Peninsula Lake, Lake of Bays and Walker Lake. Over the years other resorts have joined in and the group of select resorts now numbers fourteen properties. As a marketing cooperative the North Muskoka Resort Group changed their name to The Resorts of North Muskoka in 2011. The Resorts of North Muskoka are actively engaged in many forms of marketing the resort collective ... including this web site, social marketing, keyword bidding and news media releases. Recently the group entered a matching funds agreement with Explorers Edge RTO 12 to further brand the North Muskoka area in conjunction with the Regional Tourism Organization.

			<tr><td valign="top"><img src="images/history/bluespruce.jpg" alt="Blue Spruce" align="right" hspace="10" />The Robertson family registered the 160 acre farm and lumber operation as a Crown Grant in 1913. Charles Bishop, Secretary Treasurer of the T Eaton Company and his wife Annie, sister in law of Timothy Eaton bought the property in 1914. At that time the trip was by both train and steamship. By 1933 there was a road to the property. In 1952 Charles sold the property to his son and two years later it was sold to the Hayden family. The Hayden's transformed the property into a small resort using existing buildings. Some of the land surrounding the resort was severed and sold over the years. In 1972 it converted to full housekeeping from it's American Plan roots. In 1986 children Scott and Linda Hayden assumed the management of the resort and continue to upgrade the facility.<br /><br /></td></tr>

In the 20's they started offering platform tents and in the 1930's they built their first cottage. The resort staged concerts on the lawn of the resort from the 1910 - 1930's as the owner was a well known actor and musician of fame from Australia. The property is still part farm and up until the late 60's they still harvested hay from the property. Guests would help with the harvest. Now they buy their hay for the horses but guest still help them put it away. They do sell produce directly to guests and the kids can get fresh fresh eggs directly from the free range chicken nests. Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrov of Russia (sister of the Czar) was one notable that stayed at the farmhouse to paint. These paintings are valuable today and rest in various collections. Some guests have been coming for 52 years running. Interesting that all the gravel to build the Bigwin Island Resort came from the Bondi Resort quarry. The Tapley family continues to operate the resort to this day.<br /><br /></td></tr>

Before the resort was established it was acquired through an 1869 land grant for the family farm. Farming was difficult in the rugged rocky area and they began to supplement farming with accommodation for hunters and the resort business was born. Trains had reached Huntsville by 1886. In 1905 a secondary 22 unit annex lodge was added to the original lodge/farmhouse. Steamer service ran to the lodge from the early 1900's to the 1940's. Authors and poets like Robertson Davies and William McDonald were guests of the resort. One family still vacations at the lodge and the descendants has returned every year since 1900 to this day. Up to 1946 that family has spent their summers at Clyffe House and since 1946 the family has booked every Thanksgiving weekend including the upcoming 2013 holiday.<br /><br /></td></tr>
